# Data Pipeline with Astro CLI, Cosmos, Airflow, Google Cloud, and BigQuery


## Overview
====================

This GitHub project focuses on the development of a comprehensive data pipeline, leveraging a powerful combination of tools and technologies. The primary goal of this project is to enable efficient data processing, transformation, and storage, facilitating data-driven decision-making and analytics.

## Key Components

The project incorporates the following key components:

1. **Astro CLI**: The Astro CLI is used to set up and manage the Airflow environment, allowing for the orchestration of data workflows and tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and scheduling data pipelines.

2. **Cosmos**: Cosmos plays a vital role in data transformation and orchestration. It facilitates data cleansing, enrichment, and transformation tasks, enhancing data quality as it flows through the pipeline.

3. **Airflow**: Airflow serves as the core of the data pipeline, enabling the creation and execution of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to manage data workflows. It is responsible for tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

4. **Google Cloud**: Google Cloud provides the infrastructure for data storage, offering Google Cloud Storage for raw and processed data. It ensures scalability, security, and reliability for data storage needs.

5. **BigQuery**: BigQuery is utilized for data analysis and querying. It allows for the storage and retrieval of processed data, supporting advanced analytics and reporting.
